# backend-nodejs-solo

For this assignment you will create a full node.js backend applicationfrom scratch. 

1. Clone this project and then create your new node.js project in the created directory.

2. Your backend web service should support at least one web service import that accepts a request parameter and returns some HTML content that uses the submitted parameter. e.g. User can submit a name from their browser and your service will respond with an HTML greeting 'Hello TheirName! Welcome to my service!'

3. Once you have complete the service, commit only the files needed into this repo.
